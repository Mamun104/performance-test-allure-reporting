# performance-test-allure-reporting

## Introduction
- Are you writing functional tests in JMeter?
- Do you find it difficult to understand what went wrong using standard means?
- Do you want to see detailed test reports?
- Do you need historical data?
- Do you need to keep test documentation?

This solution can help you create reports on JMeter tests in the Allure Report format.

However, please note that it is **NOT USABLE** for load testing.

##  Quick start via docker-compose
```bash
docker compose up && \
docker cp jmeter:/result/allure-results allure-results-example &&\
docker rm -f jmeter &&\
allure generate allure-results-example --clean -o allure-report
allure open allure-report/
```
---

## Quick start via GUI-Mode
```bash
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh
./apache-jmeter/bin/jmeter -t allure-jmeter-example.jmx
allure generate allure-results/ --clean -o allure-report
allure open allure-report/
```

Then you should change the two variables in User Defined Variables to an absolute path and click RUN.

#### _ALLURE_REPORT_PATH:
- To run it via docker-compose just put `'/result/allure-results'`
- To run locally provide the absolute path to the `allure-results` folder

#### _ALLURE_CONFIG_PATH:
- To run via docker-compose, just put `allure-reporter.groovy` (this file is already located in the root directory).
- To run locally provide the absolute path to the `allure-reporter.groovy`

## How it works
First, you need to initialize the parameters that are required to generate test results:
![Optional Text](images/user_defined_variables.png)

If the case consists of several steps, it should look like this:
![Optional Text](images/multiple_steps_case.png)

Declare annotations before first step:
![Optional Text](images/multiple_steps_case_declare_annotations.png)

Declare parameters in JSR223 Assertion:
![Optional Text](images/groovy_parameters_in_multiple.png)

For example, if the case consists of one step a validation check looks like this:
![Optional Text](images/single_step_cases.png)

Do not use parameters if case has one step:
![Optional Text](images/groovy_parameters_in_signle.png)

Default report looks like this:
![Optional Text](images/jmeter_view_result_tree.png)
- After running the script, files will be created in the `allure-results` folder for generating the report.
  Next, you can generate the Allure Report by using the following command:
```bash
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
```

Allure Report would look like this:
![Optional Text](images/allure-report.png)


## Works with the following Assertions:

| Assertion                         |
|--------------------               |
| Response Assertion                |
| JSON Assertion                    |
| Size Assertion                    |
| jp@gc - JSON/YAML Path Assertion  |

It should also work with the rest of the default assertions.

## Additional features
### Skipped annotations
If you would like to ignore test case, just add 'skipped' to the parameters near 'stop':
![Optional Text](images/skipped_parameter.png)
![Optional Text](images/allure-report-skipped-case.png)

### Critical annotations
If you have critical main case to prepares data for next tests, you may use 'critical' parameters.
If this case fails - all next tests (thread group) will be stopped.
![Optional Text](images/critical_parameter.png)

### Parameters annotations
The Markdown Table Data-driven Controller plugin allows you to use parameterized tests. We can put our params to the report
1. Add Markdown Controller with params
   ![Optional Text](images/markdown-data-table.png)
2. Add variables to the main annotations like this:
   ```bash
   vars.put("allure.parameters","[capsule_name,second_example_name_variable]")
   ```
   ![Optional Text](images/test-parameter-annotations.png)
3. Add parameters to the sub annotations like this:
   ```bash
   parameters=[error_message_expected]
   
   // if step parameters more 1 - write with comma like
   // parameters=[variable1,variable2,error_message_expected]
   ```

4. Run the tests and then generate the report.

### Keep in report JSR223 Sampler
1. Just use JSR223 Sampler as simple step
2. Add sub annotation and asserts
3. Generate report
   ![Optional Text](images/jsr223-allure.png)

---

### Add description
You can add some description to your test using this variable
   ```bash
  vars.put("allure.description","Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. \\nLorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book");
   ```
### Change response content-type manually
Content-type is set automatically. If the default content-type of the response is incorrect, you can change it manually:

   ```bash
    content_type=[application/pdf]
   ```
![Optional Text](images/custom-content-type-response.png)

### Add link
You can add any links to your test like this:
   ```bash
   vars.put("allure.link.issue","https://github.com/nonealexq/jmeter-allure-reporting/issues/6");
vars.put("allure.link.docsLink","https://github.com/nonealexq/jmeter-allure-reporting/blob/master/README.md");
vars.put("allure.link.myLink","https://github.com/nonealexq");
   ```
![Optional Text](images/add-link-support.png)
---

### Add any custom label
If you want to add some custom label (for example severity/owner/tag) - you can do it!
   ```bash
  vars.put("allure.label.severity","critical");
  vars.put("allure.label.owner","None Alex");
  vars.put("allure.label.tag","smoke");
   ```

### Remove safety data in request
We do not recommend storing sensitive information in the reports. By default, all mentions of such information are overwritten

---

## Log details to console
1. The passing time of the test is logged.
2. The number of passed tests is logged.
3. Information about test passing status is logged at the end of the line along with the corresponding status.
4. Critical failed tests are logged at the WARN level.
   ![Optional Text](images/log-details.png)
5. An error is logged if the start, continue, or stop annotations are not correct.
   ![Optional Text](images/log-details-if-annotations-not-correct.png)

## Troubleshooting:
- In a test case with multiple steps, if you forget to add one of the parameters in one of the steps,
  that step will not make it to the report, and something will definitely go wrong. So, be careful!
